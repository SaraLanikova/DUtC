    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>Please read the following instructions carefully to understand how the game works and what you need to do.</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This study has <b>{{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds</b>. In each round, you will see a black die where is a randomly chosen hidden number from 1 to 6.
        To uncover the number, you have to move your cursor into it.
        After viewing the number, you will select the number you saw by clicking on one of the small squares below the die.
        Once you select the number, your choice will be automatically submitted, and you will move on to the next round.
        In the next round, there is a different random number in the die.</p>
    <h3>Payoff</h3>
    <p> Each number has a different reward. Your payoff will depend on number you report.
        Your reward in the study is in ECU (Experimental Currency Unit) and the convert ratio is <b>1 ECU = 10 CZK</b>.
        After the last round, a random round will be draw for your payoff. Based on your reported number in that round,
        you will receive your payoff and the ECU will be converted to CZK.</p>
    <p>
        {% if player.frame == 'Loss' %}
        <b>At the beginning of each round, you are endowed with {{ Constants.endowment_loss_frame }}.
        You loose ECU based on the number you report.</b>
        For example, if you report you saw 1, you will lose 1 ECU from the {{ Constants.endowment_loss_frame }}.
        If you report that you saw 6 ECU, you will lose all your endowment.

        {% elif player.frame == 'Gain' %}
        <b>In this study, you will receive an ECU based on what number you report that you saw on the dice.</b>
        For example, if you report number 1, you will receive 1 ECU. If you report number 2, you will receive 2 EUC, and so on.
        However, for 6, you will receive 0 ECU.
