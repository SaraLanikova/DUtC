    <h1>Welcome to the study!</h1>
    <p>In this experiment, you will roll a die and report the outcome. Your payoff will depend on your reported number.</p>
    <p>In this study, you will see a black square where appears a random number from 1 to 6 after you move your cursor into the square.</p>
    <p>
        {% if player.frame == 'Loss' %}
            You are endowed with {{ Constants.endowment_loss_frame }}. You lose ECU based on the number you report. For example, if you report you saw 1, you will lose 1 ECU from the {{ Constants.endowment_loss_frame }}, if you report that you saw 6 ECU, you will lose all your endowment.

        {% elif player.frame == 'Gain' %}
            In this study, you will receive an ECU based on what number you report that you saw on the dice. For example, if you report number 2, you will receive 2 ECU.
